            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Investment in renewable energy is such a fascinating policy area. It’s one of the few that feature the interplay of energy as a national utility, yet with semi-reliance on individuals and corporations as contributors to industry supply - e.g. in installing solar panels or, at a greater scale, solar farms.</p>
            <p>Much of the national conversation around renewable energy today tends to revolve around switching from gasoline power to low-emission alternatives (say, a regular petrol car vs. a Tesla, or a city transit system switching to electric buses). In many cases, this makes sense - the Department of Energy states that “electricity is less expensive than gasoline and [electric vehicles] are more efficient than gasoline vehicles”.</p>
            <p>More efficient or not, however, this still shifts the energy load from gasoline to the electrical grid, which itself is mostly generated from non-renewable sources. The generation of energy from renewable sources is a critical part of reducing emissions when we as a species increasingly consume more and more energy. The question I’m more preoccupied with is: where is all this energy coming from?</p>

                    <h2>Residential systems are the 2nd-largest source of solar energy in the US.</h2>
                    <p>Yadda yadda yadda</p>
                </div>
                <div class='step' data-step='0'>
                    <p>In fact, solar energy was the only category of renewable energy that had a "Residential" category in the data.</p>
                    <p>While utility-owned solar farms were the largest generators of solar energy in 2016, small-scale residential systems overtook the commercial sector in 2014 to become the 2nd-largest source of solar energy and the 5th-largest source of renewable energy overall.</p>
                    <p>A logical next question is: who’s actually capturing all this solar energy?</p>
                </div>
                <div class='step' data-step='1'>
                    <h2>Hawaii generates over 50 times more solar energy per capita than the national median.</h2>
                    <p>In absolute terms, however, California was the single largest residential generator of solar energy in 2016.</p>
                    <p>In fact, California and Arizona combined generated more than half of the national total. What is a bit more of a surprise is how high on the list the Northeast states like Vermont (#5), Massachussetts (#6), and New Jersey (#7) lie, especially in comparison to known sunny states like Texas (#23) or Florida (#27).</p>
                    <p>That brings me to my next question: does the amount of sunlight each state receives correlate with the solar energy it generates?</p>
                </div>
                <div class='step' data-step='2'>
                    <h2>Northeast states generate more solar energy from less sunlight.</h2>
                    <p>Relative to states in the North Central, South, and West regions, states in the Northeast generated more solar energy in 2016 than what their solar irradiance levels might suggest.</p>
                    <p>A rough upward trend seems to hold for the Western states, although there seems to be a lot of unexplained variation towards the lower end of the irradiance range. Among the Northeast states in red above, Vermont, Massachussetts, and New Jersey in particular are generating way more solar energy than neighboring states that get just as much sunlight, if not more.</p>
                    <p>While there are plenty of factors that impact the efficiency with which you generate solar energy - tilt, weather, temperature, age of technology, etc. - my immediate guess is that the most straightforward way to ramp up your output is to have more solar panels.</p>
                    <p>So - which states have the most solar panels?</p>
                </div>
                <div class='step' data-step='3'>
                    <h2>Northeast states are surprisingly well-represented in solar panels per capita.</h2>
                    <p>States like Massachussetts, New Jersey, and Connecticut are among states with the most solar panels per capita in 2016. The question now becomes - why? As we saw before, the Northeast region as a group receives the lowest annual solar irradiance among all the states. I definitely wouldn’t go to Boston for a beach weekend.</p>
                </div>
                <div class='step' data-step='4'>
                    <h2>Large panels-per-capita in the Northeast, despite low annual solar radiation.</h2>
                    <p>While the Northeast region receives the least solar irradiance in the continental United States, it also has counties with disproportionately high solar panel installation rates.</p>
                    <p>But why?</p>
