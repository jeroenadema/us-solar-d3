            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Investment in renewable energy is such a fascinating policy area. It’s one of the few that feature the interplay of energy as a national utility, yet with semi-reliance on individuals and corporations as contributors to industry supply - e.g. in installing solar panels or, at a greater scale, solar farms.</p>
            <p>Much of the national conversation around renewable energy today tends to revolve around switching from gasoline power to low-emission alternatives (say, a regular petrol car vs. a Tesla, or a city transit system switching to electric buses). In many cases, this makes sense - the Department of Energy states that “electricity is less expensive than gasoline and [electric vehicles] are more efficient than gasoline vehicles”.</p>
            <p>More efficient or not, however, this still shifts the energy load from gasoline to the electrical grid, which itself is mostly generated from non-renewable sources. The generation of energy from renewable sources is a critical part of reducing emissions when we as a species increasingly consume more and more energy (looking at you, bitcoin miners). The question I’m more preoccupied with is: where is all this energy coming from?</p>

                    <h2>Where all this energy is coming from</h2>
                    <p>First, we’ll take a look at data on solar photovoltaic energy generated by the commercial, industrial, power and residential sectors, courtesy of the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s State Energy Data Systems (SEDS) database.</p>
                    <p>Why focus on solar energy? Of all the common sources of renewable energy - solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, etc. - solar energy fascinates me because it’s so participatory. You can’t install a wind turbine in your backyard or dam up the local river, but you could invest in a set of solar panels for your house fairly easily. In the SEDS data, solar energy is also the only renewable source of energy to have a line item for “generation by small-scale applications in the residential sector”.</p>

                <div class='step' data-step='2'>
                    <p>A logical next question is: who’s actually capturing all this solar energy?</p>
                </div>
                <div class='step' data-step='3'>
                    <p>Unsurprisingly, California was the single largest residential generator of solar energy in 2016 - in fact, California and Arizona combined generated more than half of the national total. What is a bit more of a surprise is how high on the list the Northeast states like Vermont (#5), Massachussetts (#6), and New Jersey (#7) lie, especially in comparison to known sunny states like Texas (#23) or Florida (#27).</p>
                    <p>That brings me to my next question: does the amount of sunlight each state receives correlate with the solar energy it generates?</p>
                </div>
                <div class='step' data-step='4'>
                    <h2>Do sunny states generate more solar energy?</h2>
                    <p> For this, we’ll use solar irradiance data from the Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Specifically, we’re looking at Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), which is the amount of solar radiation a surface receives if placed horizonal to the ground, measured in kilowatt-hours per square meter per day (kWh/m2/day). Since we’re dealing with residential installations here, roofs might be sloped in a particular direction, but we’ll assume that they more or less average out to horizontal position in the full dataset.</p>
                </div>
                <div class='step' data-step='5'>
                    <p>A rough upward trend seems to hold for the Western states, although there seems to be a lot of unexplained variation towards the lower end of the irradiance range. Among the Northeast states in red above, Vermont, Massachussetts, and New Jersey in particular are generating way more solar energy than neighboring states that get just as much sunlight, if not more.</p>
                    <p>While there are plenty of factors that impact the efficiency with which you generate solar energy - tilt, weather, temperature, age of technology, etc. - my immediate guess is that the most straightforward way to ramp up your output is to have more solar panels.</p>
                </div>
                <div class='step' data-step='6'>
                    <h2>Which states have the most solar panels?</h2>
                    <p>To answer this question, we’ll use historical solar panel installation data from OpenPV, the open-source database maintained by NREL.</p>
                    <p>An easy way for a state to have lots of solar panels is to have lots of people, but that’s not a particularly novel insight. Thus, a critical second step is to normalize our solar panel counts by population size - this lets us identify the states with high numbers of solar panels relative to how many people they have.</p>
                    <p>Now, let’s briefly check which states have the largest number of residential solar panels installed relative to the number of residents they have.</p>
                </div>
                <div class='step' data-step='7'>
                    <p>Sure enough - Northeast states like Massachussetts, New Jersey, and Connecticut are among states with the most solar panels per capita in 2016. The question now becomes - why? As we saw before, the Northeast region as a group receives the lowest annual solar irradiance among all the states. I definitely wouldn’t go to Boston for a beach weekend.</p>
