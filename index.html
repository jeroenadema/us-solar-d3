            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Investment in renewable energy is such a fascinating policy area. It’s one of the few that feature the interplay of energy as a national utility, yet with semi-reliance on individuals and corporations as contributors to industry supply - e.g. in installing solar panels or, at a greater scale, solar farms.</p>
            <p>Much of the national conversation around renewable energy today tends to revolve around switching from gasoline power to low-emission alternatives (say, a regular petrol car vs. a Tesla, or a city transit system switching to electric buses). In many cases, this makes sense - the Department of Energy states that “electricity is less expensive than gasoline and [electric vehicles] are more efficient than gasoline vehicles”.</p>
            <p>More efficient or not, however, this still shifts the energy load from gasoline to the electrical grid, which itself is mostly generated from non-renewable sources. The generation of energy from renewable sources is a critical part of reducing emissions in a world of accelerating energy consumption. The question I’m more preoccupied with is: where is all this energy coming from?</p>

                    <h2>Residential systems are the 2nd-largest source of solar energy in the US.</h2>
                    <p>In fact, solar energy was the only category of renewable energy that had a "Residential" category in the data.</p>
                </div>
                <div class='step' data-step='0'>
                    <h2>Now let's look only at sources of <font color="#FF810F">solar energy</font>.</h2>
                    <p>While utility-owned solar farms were the largest generators of solar energy in 2016, <font color="#5D2BF0">small-scale residential systems</font> overtook the commercial sector in 2014 to become the 2nd-largest source of solar energy and the 5th-largest source of renewable energy overall.</p>
                    <p>This group - residential solar panel systems - is the one we'll focus on.</p>
                    <p>A logical next question is: who’s actually capturing all this solar energy?</p>
                </div>
                <div class='step' data-step='1'>
                    <h2><font color="#FF810F">Hawaii</font> generates over 50 times more solar energy per capita than the national median.</h2>
                    <p>In absolute terms, however, <font color="#FF810F">California</font> was the single largest residential generator - producing 48.6% of total solar energy output in the US in 2016.</p>
                    <p>What is a bit more of a surprise is how high on the list the Northeast states like <font color="#FF810F">Vermont</font> (#5), <font color="#FF810F">Massachussetts</font> (#6), and <font color="#FF810F">New Jersey</font> (#7) lie, especially in comparison to known sunny states like <font color="#FF810F">Texas</font> (#23) or <font color="#5D2BF0">Florida</font> (#27).</p>
                    <p>That brings me to my next question: does the amount of sunlight each state receives correlate with the solar energy it generates?</p>
                </div>
                <div class='step' data-step='2'>
                    <h2><font color="#5D2BF0">Northeast states</font> generate more solar energy from less sunlight.</h2>
                    <p>Relative to states in the North Central, South, and West regions, states in the <font color="#5D2BF0">Northeast</font> generated more solar energy in 2016 than what their solar irradiance levels might suggest.</p>
                    <p>In particular, there seems to be a lot of unexplained variation towards the lower end of the irradiance range. <font color="#5D2BF0">Vermont</font>, <font color="#5D2BF0">Massachussetts</font>, and <font color="#5D2BF0">New Jersey</font> in particular are generating way more solar energy than neighboring states that get just as much sunlight, if not more.</p>
                    <p>While there are plenty of factors that impact the efficiency with which you generate solar energy, my immediate guess is that the most straightforward way to ramp up your output is to have more solar panels.</p>
                    <p>So - which states have the most solar panels?</p>
                </div>
                <div class='step' data-step='3'>
                    <h2><font color="#5D2BF0">Northeast states</font> are surprisingly well-represented in solar panels per capita.</h2>
                    <p>States like <font color="#5D2BF0">Massachussetts</font>, <font color="#5D2BF0">New Jersey</font>, and <font color="#5D2BF0">Connecticut</font> are among states with the most solar panels per capita in 2016.</p>
                </div>
                <div class='step' data-step='4'>
                    <h2>Large panels-per-capita in the Northeast, despite low annual solar radiation.</h2>
                    <p>While the Northeast region receives the least solar irradiance in the continental United States, it also has counties with disproportionately high solar panel installation rates.</p>
